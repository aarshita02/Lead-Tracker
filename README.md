# Lead-Tracker
Since this is a Chrome extension, the Save tab feature might not work on a browser window. To download the extension [click here](chrome://extensions/?id=llinoiipabfdogoihdcecnkmfnlomadd).

This project is in itself meant to be a google chrome web browser extension. This allows you to track leads (websites) whether you copy-paste the link or simply by adding the entire current tab. Upon pressing the add button, you will be able to see all your leads in an unordered list. Whenever you save or delete your leads, they are added and deleted to and from your local storage.
